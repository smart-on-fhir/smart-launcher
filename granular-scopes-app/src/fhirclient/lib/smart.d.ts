 *
 * **Be careful with init()!** There are some details you need to be aware of:
 *
 * 1. It will only work if your launch_uri is the same as your redirect_uri.
 *    While this should be valid, we can’t promise that every EHR will allow you
 *    to register client with such settings.
 * 2. Internally, `init()` will be called twice. First it will redirect to the
 *    EHR, then the EHR will redirect back to the page where init() will be
 *    called again to complete the authorization. This is generally fine,
 *    because the returned promise will only be resolved once, after the second
 *    execution, but please also consider the following:
 *    - You should wrap all your app’s code in a function that is only executed
 *      after `init()` resolves!
 *    - Since the page will be loaded twice, you must be careful if your code
 *      has global side effects that can persist between page reloads
 *      (for example writing to localStorage).
 * 3. For standalone launch, only use init in combination with offline_access
 *    scope. Once the access_token expires, if you don’t have a refresh_token
 *    there is no way to re-authorize properly. We detect that and delete the
 *    expired access token, but it still means that the user will have to
 *    refresh the page twice to re-authorize.
 * @param env The adapter
 * @param options The authorize options
